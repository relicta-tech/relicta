# Relicta - Product Vision

This living statement captures why Relicta exists, the core insight behind the product, and the future we are building. The full vision (including governance shifts, CGP, agentic controls, and strategic positioning) is kept in `docs/internal/vision.md` for internal audiences.

## Public summary

- **Why we exist:** Decision-making, not execution, is now the hardest part of shipping software; agents and CI generate change faster than humans can reason about it.
- **Core belief:** Relicta optimizes for whether a change should ship, not just how fast it can move.
- **Shift:** Software delivery is moving from shipping artifacts to governing decisions; the canonical workflow is Proposal → Evaluation → Decision → Execution → Communication (CGP).
- **Long-term view:** Governed automation unlocks speed with trust, with Relicta acting as the durable control plane between agents and production.
- **Signature promise:** Teams keep moving fast without guessing because every change has an explicit, auditable decision.
